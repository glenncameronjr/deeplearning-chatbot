SIX MORAL TALES

2
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,757
1ST PROLOGUE - HAYDEE

3
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:07,258
2ND PROLOGUE - DANIEL

4
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,459
We must all realize
our full potential.

5
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:14,064
Those who don't
are like the people in Versailles<i>,</i>

6
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,565
who surround those who do.

7
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:22,173
Those who do are inevitably
surrounded and aggressive.

8
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,869
This<i>,</i> for instance<i>,</i> is perfect.

9
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,445
It couldn't be better.

10
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,448
It's painting.

11
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,285
It's thought encircled...

12
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,429
by razor blades.
I'm bleeding.

13
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,559
That is to say<i>,</i>

14
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,794
it's unique...

15
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,475
taking nothing as its cause.

16
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,778
Encircled by its own thought<i>,</i>
as if by razor blades.

17
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,320
Impossible to hold.

18
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,245
Here's proof.

19
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,989
It was done on purpose.

20
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,560
Not your cut.
But that was done on purpose.

21
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,094
I'd like other people
to get cut<i>,</i> not you.

22
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,431
You like people to get cut on art?

23
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,869
Other people<i>,</i> yes.
But not you.

24
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,846
You're sharp. You shouldn't get cut.
That bothers me.

25
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,776
I don't mind getting cut.

26
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,408
Doesn't it hurt?

27
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,555
I surround myself
with dangerous people.

28
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:48,850
You remind me of elegant people
in the 18th century

29
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,394
who were very concerned
with their appearance

30
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,998
and the effect
they had on others.

31
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,131
That was already a creation<i>,</i>
the beginning of the Revolution.

32
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,569
The distance<i>,</i>
established by elegance<i>,</i>

33
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,572
from those
who aren't elegant is crucial.

34
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:08,838
It creates a kind of void
around the person<i>,</i>

35
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,849
and it's that void
around the person

36
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,282
that you create<i>,</i>
with your objects too.

37
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,185
But you could just as well do
without your objects.

38
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,486
You yourself are the can of paint
surrounded by razor blades<i>,</i>

39
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,186
as was Saint-Just.

40
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,764
Razor blades are words.

41
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,798
They could be silence.

42
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,028
They could also be elegance...

43
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,706
a certain yellow.

44
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,676
3RD PROLOGUE: ADRIEN

45
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,245
<i>Perhaps style is</i>
<i>more important than beauty.</i>

46
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,681
<i>But in love, the notion</i>
<i>of beauty is essential.</i>

47
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,048
We love someone
because we find him handsome.

48
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,554
No<i>,</i> we find him handsome
because we love him.

49
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,896
Yes<i>,</i> a man may be ugly
yet have immense charm.

50
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,995
If he's loved<i>,</i> his ugliness
is transformed into beauty.

51
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,397
For me an ugly man
has no charm.

52
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,236
Nothing's possible.
It's over immediately.

53
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,442
What's over?

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,116
Anything. Even the most
superficial relationship.

55
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,717
Even to have a drink
for five minutes. I can't.

56
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,511
If he's ugly<i>,</i> I leave.

57
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:26,488
Can you be friends
with someone you find ugly?

58
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,226
Ugliness and beauty
don't enter into my friendships.

59
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:36,061
I don't see my friends
as either ugly or handsome.

60
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,697
But friendship doesn't
happen in five minutes.

61
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,907
It takes several encounters.

62
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,942
How do you manage that
with someone you find ugly?

63
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,976
I run. It's impossible.

64
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,978
It's not a question
of ugliness.

65
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:55,621
Among crowds of beautiful people<i>,</i>
I'm only interested

66
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,087
in those who possess
something more than beauty.

67
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,385
Someone of absolute beauty
would bore me.

68
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,597
I'm not talking
about Greek beauty.

69
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,028
Absolute beauty doesn't exist.

70
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,031
To find someone handsome<i>,</i>

71
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,667
sometimes the tiniest thing
is enough.

72
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,740
Perhaps something
between the nose and mouth.

73
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,811
So anyone has a chance
of appealing to you.

74
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,845
At least a chance.

75
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,577
No<i>,</i> that's the problem.
I find very few people handsome.

76
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,188
And it really hampers
my relationships terribly<i>,</i>

77
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,951
because if I'm repelled<i>,</i>
I never see that person again.

78
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,923
And since many people repel me -

79
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,791
You never change your mind?

80
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,399
The first thing I say
if I'm asked to dinner

81
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:46,060
isn't "What does he do?"
But "Is he handsome?"

82
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,766
And ugly ones
are always doomed?

83
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,466
To the ovens.

84
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,636
They deserve it.

85
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,815
Ugliness is an insult to others.

86
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,610
One's responsible for one's looks.

87
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,117
For instance<i>,</i>
a nose moves or ages

88
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,257
according to how
one thinks or speaks.

89
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,622
Besides<i>,</i> I'm not talking
about static beauty.

90
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,026
One's movements<i>,</i>
expressions<i>,</i> gait -

91
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,527
all that counts<i>,</i> doesn't it?

92
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,686
How long will you stay
in London?

93
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,793
At least five weeks.

94
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,364
Your modeling
won't take up all that time.

95
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,069
No<i>,</i> but I have
lots of friends to see.

96
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,761
And I love London in July.

97
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,836
Why not come to the Riviera?

98
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,243
Rodolphe is lending me his villa.

99
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,938
I have lots of things to do.

100
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,852
Earlier you said you didn't.
Come for a few days at least.

101
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,289
It's not worth it.
Why don't you come to London?

102
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,894
What would I do there?

103
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,690
What will you do
all alone on the Riviera?

104
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,992
I have business meetings.

105
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:26,698
What business? I've never really
believed in your so-called business.

106
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,437
I have to go to a sale<i>,</i>
track down a silent partner<i>,</i>

107
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,137
a collector of Chinese antiques.

108
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,483
He's financing a gallery for me.

109
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,852
Don't you think you'd make
better contacts in London?

110
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,923
I see only serious people
and do only serious things.

111
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,561
Come along<i>,</i> you'll see.

112
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,993
- No<i>,</i> I'm not coming.
- Why not?

113
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,392
Because from time to time<i>,</i>

114
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,003
one of us has to do
something serious.

115
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,833
But I am serious.

116
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,204
Why do you always dash off
when we could be together?

117
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,174
I'd like you to come.

118
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,708
I'd like it very much.

119
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,941
Why don't you come to London?

120
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,016
I already told you: I can't.

121
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,450
Well<i>,</i> in that case -

122
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,752
END OF PROLOGUES

123
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,754
<i>No sooner had I arrived</i>
<i>than Daniel told me the bad news. ;</i>

124
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,860
<i>A girl was staying here</i>
<i>at Rodolphe's invitation.</i>

125
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,194
<i>She would surely disturb us.</i>

126
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,596
Maite?

127
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,933
Haydee.

128
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,904
Doesn't ring a bell.

129
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,240
Besides<i>,</i> all those girls
leave me cold.

130
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,079
Well<i>,</i> it's only for 24 days.

131
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,877
What type?

132
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,521
A dumb bunny.
Round face.

133
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,457
Close-cropped hair.
Charming.

134
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,525
She lives here?

135
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,060
In principle<i>,</i> yes.

136
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,664
She panhandles here and there.
Brings guys here sometimes.

137
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,238
That's just like Rodolphe.

138
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,931
He surrounds himself
with the plainest people.

139
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:29,704
Anyway<i>,</i> if they bother us<i>,</i>
we'll kick them all out<i>,</i> including her.

140
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,542
<i>I wanted to be by myself,</i>

141
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,482
<i>but Daniel's presence</i>
<i>was no problem.</i>

142
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,746
<i>Since I lived all year</i>
<i>without fixed hours or dates,</i>

143
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,949
<i>I decided to set</i>
<i>some rules for myself.</i>

144
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,890
<i>The monastic feel</i>
<i>of my room helped.</i>

145
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,103
<i>First, I'd get up early.</i>

146
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:07,009
<i>I'd always backed into the dawn</i>
<i>after having stayed up all night.</i>

147
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,746
<i>Now I'd live mornings</i>
<i>in the right order,</i>

148
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,421
<i>and associate them,</i>
<i>as most people do,</i>

149
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,597
<i>with the idea</i>
<i>of awakening and beginning.</i>

150
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,832
<i>The idea was both</i>
<i>invigorating and oppressive.</i>

151
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,612
<i>I had to shift my schedule</i>
<i>back a third of a day</i>

152
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:38,807
<i>so that by evening I'd be too tired</i>
<i>to be tempted to go out.</i>

153
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,879
<i>And what did I intend to do?</i>

154
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,521
<i>Precisely nothing.</i>

155
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,560
<i>For once I'd take</i>
<i>a real vacation,</i>

156
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,696
<i>because my real work had always</i>
<i>begun when others' stopped. ;</i>

157
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:56,197
at parties<i>,</i> on weekends<i>,</i>
at the beach<i>,</i> in the mountains.

158
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:00,631
<i>But this year only one thing</i>
<i>interested me. ; my art gallery.</i>

159
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,668
<i>Nothing else mattered.</i>

160
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,867
<i>And since all preparations</i>
<i>had been completed,</i>

161
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,909
<i>all I could do was wait.</i>

162
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:18,219
<i>Having nothing to do</i>
<i>for the first time in 10 years,</i>

163
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,120
<i>I undertook to really do nothing.</i>

164
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:26,697
<i>That is, to take inactivity</i>
<i>to a level I'd never before reached.</i>

165
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,208
<i>I even tried not to think.</i>

166
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,620
<i>I was alone</i>
<i>face to face with the sea,</i>

167
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,450
<i>far from cruises and beaches,</i>

168
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,024
<i>fulfilling a childhood dream</i>

169
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,957
<i>put off year after year.</i>

170
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:07,135
<i>I wanted my gaze of the sea</i>
<i>to be as empty as possible,</i>

171
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,368
<i>void of any painterly</i>
<i>or botanical curiosity.</i>

172
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,304
<i>For if I'd followed</i>
<i>earlier inclinations,</i>

173
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,539
<i>I might have been</i>
<i>an art collector or botanist.</i>

174
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,354
<i>I lost myself completely</i>

175
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,550
<i>in the play of shadow and light,</i>

176
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,925
<i>sinking into a lethargy</i>
<i>heightened by the water.</i>

177
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,600
<i>That state of passivity,</i>
<i>of complete availability,</i>

178
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:41,204
<i>promised to last much longer</i>
<i>than the euphoria</i>

179
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,843
<i>of one's first summer dip</i>
<i>in the ocean.</i>

180
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:49,945
<i>I could easily see myself spending</i>
<i>a whole month this way.</i>

181
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:31,117
<i>That's why I couldn't bear the idea</i>
<i>of seeing anyone but Daniel.</i>

182
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,917
<i>The only woman I would have liked</i>
<i>to have with me was far away.</i>

183
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,625
<i>I'd resigned myself to it</i>

184
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,664
<i>and dismissed</i>
<i>without much difficulty -</i>

185
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,893
<i>forever, I suspected-</i>
<i>the thought of her.</i>

186
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,335
<i>But I wasn't ready</i>
<i>to tolerate another,</i>

187
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,874
<i>especially not one of Rodolphe's</i>
<i>pathetic little protegees.</i>

188
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,650
The world belongs
to those who get up early.

189
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,990
I intend to swim
every morning at sunrise.

190
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,783
And I at noon.

191
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,218
Are you reading this?

192
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,416
No<i>,</i> you can take it.

193
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,232
<i>In that quest for nothing,</i>
<i>for emptiness,</i>

194
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,497
<i>Daniel had his own way,</i>

195
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,197
<i>more direct and brutal than mine.</i>

196
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,877
<i>I almost considered him</i>
<i>my mentor on the subject.</i>

197
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,846
<i>- Nothing?</i>
- Nothing.

198
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,014
<i>Nothing at all?</i>

199
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,616
Absolutely<i>,</i> positively nothing.

200
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,355
I've done absolutely nothing
since I arrived<i>,</i>

201
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,717
and I actually do
less every day.

202
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,126
I want to reach absolute zero.

203
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,090
It's very difficult.

204
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,195
It takes enormous
effort and care.

205
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:25,060
It comes to me naturally.
It's my nature.

206
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:29,098
But it's more tiring to follow
one's nature than to fight it.

207
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,141
Besides<i>,</i> you're reading.
That's doing something.

208
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,312
If I didn't read<i>,</i> I'd think<i>,</i>

209
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:39,382
and thinking is the hardest<i>,</i>
most demanding thing of all.

210
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,146
I think people think too much.

211
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,482
The main thing is to be absorbed<i>,</i>

212
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,629
and a book
forces me to think its way.

213
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,890
What I don't want
is to think my own way.

214
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,567
I want to be led.

215
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,896
Like an Arab.
In a street<i>,</i> he feels the street<i>,</i>

216
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,697
while we think about the goal.

217
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:06,037
It was an Arab who said<i>,</i> "One is
the first figure of an endless number."

218
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,747
An idea is a flash.

219
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,884
We have just three or four
original ideas in our lifetime.

220
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,916
People who are always
thinking don't exist.

221
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,484
Look at Dali's "melted watches<i>,</i>"
for example.

222
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,021
It's true.
I'm looking for nothing.

223
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,728
If I come across Rousseau<i>,</i>
I read Rousseau.

224
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,333
I could just as well
read <i>Don Quixote.</i>

225
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,933
If a pretty girl fell in my arms<i>,</i>
I'd take her<i>,</i>

226
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,167
though at the moment
I have no desire to get involved.

227
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,013
What if Haydee
crawled into your bed?

228
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,909
You mean that girl?

229
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,209
Did she crawl into yours?

230
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,953
No<i>,</i> she's always got someone.

231
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,280
But that's the strategist in her.

232
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,083
That doesn't matter.

233
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,387
She hasn't reached that point yet.

234
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:01,692
For 24 to 48 hours<i>,</i>
she can even be remarkably faithful.

235
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,535
<i>Three or four days</i>
<i>after I arrived,</i>

236
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,173
<i>at 2.;00 a. M...</i>

237
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:54,744
<i>Coming back from my swim,</i>
<i>I saw her with a boy her age.</i>

238
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,234
<i>A little later,</i>
<i>they came down into the yard.</i>

239
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,834
<i>From what Daniel had told me,</i>

240
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,372
<i>I'd expected another girl</i>
<i>whom I'd seen at Rodolphe's,</i>

241
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,567
<i>a repulsive pest.</i>

242
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,609
Let's kill a chicken.

243
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,675
<i>The only similarity</i>
<i>was the haircut.</i>

244
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,753
<i>I couldn't make out her face</i>
<i>at that distance,</i>

245
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,584
<i>and I'm not very good</i>
<i>at faces anyway.</i>

246
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:38,088
<i>Anyway, I could already tell</i>
<i>I'd give this girl as well</i>

247
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,266
<i>little chance</i>
<i>of getting along with me.</i>

248
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,299
<i>She'd recognized me as the man</i>
<i>who'd entered her room</i>

249
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,701
<i>at Rodolphe's country place</i>
<i>two weeks earlier.</i>

250
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,241
Haydee<i>,</i> have you met Adrien?

251
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,942
I think so.

252
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,480
We must have met at Rodolphe's.

253
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,053
Ah<i>,</i> right.

254
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,046
I see.

255
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,182
It's a pity Rodolphe
isn't here this year.

256
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,725
I know he hates traveling.

257
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,060
Charlie.

258
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,130
I know boats.
My father's in the business.

259
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,530
He invented
the first yacht made of plastic.

260
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,869
And what do you do?

261
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,200
What?

262
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,001
I mean for work.

263
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,607
- I'm a doctor.
- A regular doctor?

264
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,907
No<i>,</i> an eye specialist.

265
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:08,644
And I see
you can barely stand daylight.

266
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,616
Are you serious?

267
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,818
My first impressions
are always correct.

268
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,096
Let me see your glasses.

269
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,603
Prescription?

270
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,867
No<i>,</i> just sunglasses
I bought in a store.

271
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,240
It's dangerous
to buy any old junk.

272
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:40,248
Junk! I paid 150 francs for them.
They're Polaroid.

273
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,051
Polarization is like extrapolation<i>,</i>

274
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,488
an already obsolete theory.

275
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,087
Today we're coming back
to the old idea:

276
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,631
That the only protection
from the sun

277
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,633
is color<i>,</i> and vice versa.

278
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,930
Look at the ones
I prescribed for Daniel.

279
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,904
Two colors:
Blue and magenta.

280
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,345
Both are effective
against harmful rays.

281
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,781
What's magenta?

282
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,529
<i>The racket started again</i>
<i>the next night.</i>

283
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,931
<i>I decided it would be</i>
<i>the last time.</i>

284
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,877
Quiet<i>,</i> young lady!

285
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,070
I'm afraid you have
to leave<i>,</i> buddy.

286
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,108
Who are you?
I don't know you.

287
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,007
You disturbed my rest<i>,</i> sir.

288
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,579
It's a pity.

289
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,351
Might is right.

290
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,527
Okay<i>,</i> I'll go.

291
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,796
My father won't be back for a week.
Come to my house?

292
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,544
You're not staying with these jerks.
- Yes<i>,</i> I am.

293
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,367
<i>A newly docile Haydee</i>
<i>brought no more guests to the house.</i>

294
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,799
<i>She settled for phone calls</i>
<i>around 8.;00 p.m.</i>

295
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,564
Take the path.
The house is 200 yards away.

296
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,969
Not the road<i>,</i> the path.

297
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,278
Tell me about it later.

298
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,675
Okay<i>,</i> see you later.
Kisses.

299
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,423
<i>She usually came home at dawn,</i>
<i>when I was getting up.</i>

300
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:19,093
<i>It wasn't always the same boy</i>
<i>who'd picked her up the night before.</i>

301
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,674
<i>Since she spent her days sleeping,</i>
<i>we saw very little of her.</i>

302
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,846
<i>Then one evening,</i>
<i>in need of a ride, she asked me.</i>

303
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,422
<i>Is Werner there, please?</i>

304
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,690
Do you know
when he'll be back?

305
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,630
Tell him Haydee called.

306
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,893
H-a-y-d-e-e.

307
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,904
Can you give me a ride?

308
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,737
- What for?
- I have a date.

309
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,243
- Who?
- You don't know him.

310
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,848
Make sure
the next one has a car.

311
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,155
- So you can't?
- I can<i>,</i> but I don't want to.

312
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,830
Darling<i>,</i> you lack
any sense of propriety.

313
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,022
Look at Daniel and me.

314
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,669
We've found happiness
in virtue and the simple life.

315
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,844
You find happiness
where you can.

316
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,411
Come for a swim
tomorrow at 7:00?

317
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,138
Okay.

318
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:15,309
<i>Haydee took me up on my offer,</i>
<i>which, I must say, I rather liked.</i>

319
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,886
<i>The situation</i>
<i>had been cleared up.</i>

320
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,983
<i>Like Daniel, she would be</i>
<i>part of my solitude.</i>

321
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,820
<i>Since she was there,</i>
<i>better to assimilate her.</i>

322
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,460
<i>I made our relationship</i>
<i>clear at once. ;</i>

323
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,495
<i>simple friendship.</i>

324
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,905
<i>I knew she would have liked</i>
<i>exactly the opposite. ;</i>

325
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:40,304
<i>a courtship of equal parts</i>
<i>insolence and devotion.</i>

326
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,771
<i>That was my style.</i>

327
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,380
<i>With any other girl, that is.</i>

328
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:24,251
<i>In any case, for several days,</i>
<i>we all got along quite pleasantly,</i>

329
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:28,255
<i>each engrossed</i>
<i>in his own pursuits,</i>

330
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,552
<i>as well as chores</i>
<i>around the house,</i>

331
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,731
<i>to which we purposely attached</i>
<i>exaggerated importance.</i>

332
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:49,341
<i>Haydee proved quite compatible</i>
<i>and able to follow our lead,</i>

333
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,414
<i>without imitating</i>
<i>our quirks too much.</i>

334
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:13,266
<i>Nevertheless, I could sense</i>
<i>a hitch somewhere,</i>

335
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,099
<i>although Haydee very cleverly</i>
<i>hid the game that,</i>

336
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,504
<i>rightly or wrongly,</i>
<i>I suspected she was playing.</i>

337
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,711
<i>It was precisely this reserved quality</i>
<i>that bothered me.</i>

338
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,883
<i>So I decided to take a risk,</i>

339
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,485
<i>afraid of settling</i>
<i>for the easy way out,</i>

340
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,746
<i>and force the issue.</i>

341
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,617
Shall we sit here?

342
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,792
Catch.

343
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,282
The worst thing around here
is the wine.

344
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,044
It's disgusting.

345
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,113
I don't drink it anymore.

346
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,454
It's wrong to drink
something one doesn't like<i>,</i>

347
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,151
to accept things one dislikes<i>,</i>

348
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,387
see people one dislikes...

349
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,096
caress a girl one dislikes.

350
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,702
It's the height of immorality.

351
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:25,274
My greatest defect is to try
to confirm my first impressions.

352
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:31,412
For example<i>,</i> I know if I don't like
a girl's nose<i>,</i> her legs will leave me cold.

353
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,207
Then don't touch them.

354
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,679
Besides -

355
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,153
What?

356
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,018
Listen<i>,</i> I don't like
you running after me.

357
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,522
I'm not.

358
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,958
Yes<i>,</i> you are.
I can tell when a girl's interested.

359
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,496
Under other circumstances<i>,</i>
you could have me.

360
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,930
I'm too weak
and accommodating.

361
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,663
One must know when to be moral.

362
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,603
And when I think of you
as a girl I might sleep with<i>,</i>

363
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,074
all I see is your faults.

364
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,873
Though you must have
some good qualities.

365
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,448
You think so?

366
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,315
Why not go after Daniel?

367
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,253
Of course<i>,</i> he's far superior
to you as a person<i>,</i>

368
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,119
but his morals
are less rigid than mine.

369
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,928
You're not the only two men
around<i>,</i> you know.

370
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,395
I know<i>,</i> Haydee.
You're too attractive.

371
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,869
We both carry the same cross.

372
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:36,242
<i>My tactic apparently</i>
<i>hadn't worked.</i>

373
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,876
<i>But the feeling left</i>
<i>in both of us by my blundering</i>

374
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,881
<i>poisoned our relationship.</i>

375
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,890
<i>But this little game</i>
<i>of hide-and-seek,</i>

376
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,254
<i>far from protecting</i>
<i>my cherished solitude,</i>

377
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,862
<i>introduced an element</i>
<i>of drama and uncertainty into it.</i>

378
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,964
<i>It forced me to focus</i>
<i>more and more on her.</i>

379
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:35,101
<i>And Daniel proved</i>
<i>a bad counselor on this point,</i>

380
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:39,265
<i>his own mysterious attitude</i>
<i>adding to my concerns.</i>

381
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,002
Haydee went looking for you
at the beach.

382
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,773
Really? What for?

383
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,710
I don't know. I can't imagine
what she wants with you.

384
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,983
Listen.

385
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,686
Do me a favor.

386
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,759
I'm ready to kick her out.

387
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,622
That's not it.

388
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,660
Daniel<i>,</i> take her.

389
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,297
Take her yourself
and leave me alone.

390
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,940
I'm asking a favor of you.

391
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:17,907
No<i>,</i> my friend. I don't do
that kind of favor for anyone.

392
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,610
Sleep with her.
In fact<i>,</i> if I were you<i>,</i> I'd charge ahead.

393
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,720
Then go ahead and charge.

394
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,054
I've no desire
to make the slightest effort.

395
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,524
And even if I wanted to<i>,</i>

396
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,027
I'm not sure I'd succeed.

397
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:38,191
You can't tell me
you'd have trouble laying that tart.

398
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,767
Yes<i>,</i> I would.

399
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,634
I decided long ago
not to run after any girl.

400
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,706
It tires me out.

401
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,672
But since she's after you<i>,</i>
take her.

402
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,645
She's quite delightful.
- That's just it.

403
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:57,880
I'm fed up with these silly girls
everyone goes crazy over

404
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,452
and passes around freely.

405
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,525
It depresses me.

406
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:07,994
Oh<i>,</i> perversity still holds it attractions<i>,</i>
but not with that kind of ugly duckling.

407
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,265
Please!

408
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,328
She wouldn't have me.

409
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,936
Be serious<i>,</i> Daniel.

410
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,902
I am serious.

411
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,807
The more girls a guy has<i>,</i>
the more suspicious I am.

412
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,243
Better to turn them off
than turn them on. It feeds my ego.

413
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,541
I'm happy not to be
part of her collection.

414
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,412
Her guys aren't so bad.

415
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,520
Maybe<i>,</i> but it doesn't matter.

416
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:35,180
I don't give a damn
whether a girl likes me or not.

417
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,255
So you really won't do it for me?

418
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,486
That's enough!

419
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,563
Daniel<i>,</i> my friend<i>,</i>
I just don't get you.

420
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,499
Screw her<i>,</i> old man!

421
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,243
<i>Despite my temporary status</i>
<i>as a hermit,</i>

422
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,279
<i>I hadn't totally</i>
<i>cut myself off from the world.</i>

423
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,180
<i>I accepted an invitation</i>
<i>to dinner one night,</i>

424
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:10,755
<i>well aware that this outing, though</i>
<i>justified from a business viewpoint,</i>

425
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,931
<i>sounded the death knell</i>
<i>for my prior noble resolutions.</i>

426
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,593
<i>It clarified my thoughts immensely,</i>

427
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:20,259
<i>and I began to grasp</i>
<i>the enormity of my blunder.</i>

428
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,073
<i>The quarrel,</i>
<i>if there was one,</i>

429
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,836
<i>wasn't between the girl and me</i>
<i>but me and Daniel,</i>

430
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:32,641
<i>who was racking up points</i>
<i>attacking our irony and our poses.</i>

431
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,557
<i>Coming home at dawn,</i>
<i>I sensed the game had been rigged,</i>

432
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,320
<i>that a crucial card</i>
<i>was missing from the deck,</i>

433
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,430
<i>a fact to be made</i>
<i>only too clear</i>

434
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:52,125
<i>that very moment.</i>

435
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,286
<i>In the morning,</i>
<i>Daniel treated the girl sullenly,</i>

436
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,464
<i>less to throw me off track,</i>
<i>since he guessed that I knew,</i>

437
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,394
<i>than to surprise me.</i>

438
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:32,833
<i>This new assault hurt her</i>
<i>even more than my own recent attacks,</i>

439
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,841
<i>which bothered me.</i>

440
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,318
<i>On the outs with both of us,</i>

441
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,659
<i>she was forced to resume</i>
<i>her nocturnal escapades.</i>

442
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,600
I'm coming.

443
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,598
You're heading downhill.

444
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,766
No<i>,</i> uphill.

445
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,045
<i>A period of open hostility ensued</i>

446
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,776
<i>during which</i>
<i>our respective talents -</i>

447
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,784
<i>hers and ours -</i>

448
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,048
<i>found their greatest expression.</i>

449
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,557
I found a label for Haydee.

450
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,730
She's a collector.

451
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:31,495
Haydee<i>,</i> if you sleep around
with no plan at all<i>,</i>

452
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,870
you're on the lowest rung
of the human ladder:

453
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,232
The revolting ingenue.

454
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,172
Now<i>,</i> if you collected
in some consistent way<i>,</i>

455
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,580
putting your mind to it<i>,</i>
plotting things out<i>,</i>

456
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,845
that would change everything.

457
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,216
Yes<i>,</i> but she's a lousy collector.

458
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,155
I'm not a collector.

459
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,689
Don't say that.
It's all you've got going for you.

460
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,025
You're completely mistaken.
I'm searching.

461
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,293
I'm trying to find something.

462
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,197
I might make mistakes.

463
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,842
She doesn't collect.
She takes what she finds.

464
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,705
She doesn't know
what "distance" means.

465
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,311
No<i>,</i> I make the most of things<i>,</i>
maybe anything.

466
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,748
The main thing is that
I get something from it.

467
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,944
No<i>,</i> you scrape the barrel<i>,</i>

468
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,420
and you end up
with nothing but a pile

469
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,354
that collapses
'cause it has no substance.

470
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,393
- You scrape the barrel too.
- I'm a barbarian!

471
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,258
If I slept with you<i>,</i>
it was without the slightest thought.

472
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:39,497
You make no sense.
You criticize me for taking anything<i>,</i>

473
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,637
but you brag
about doing it yourself.

474
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,232
You're not a barbarian.
You've got no right to behave like one.

475
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,976
But I do!

476
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,148
A barbarian must always
be killing something.

477
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:54,806
Whether I slept with you or not
changes nothing.

478
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,986
I slept with you
the minute I saw you.

479
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,952
Where was that?

480
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,421
She was dancing. And you?

481
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,253
She was making love.

482
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,222
Physically<i>,</i> that is.

483
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,524
In bed with some guy.

484
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,865
I thought the room was empty.

485
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:24,043
See that? You have slept with her.
Every man has<i>,</i> the slut.

486
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,342
The collector is
such a miserable specimen<i>,</i>

487
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,781
interested only in numbers.

488
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,387
He'll never be happy
with one object.

489
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,686
In his search
for a truly unique object<i>,</i>

490
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,885
he inevitably ends up
with a whole set.

491
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,893
A far cry from purity.

492
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,630
Elimination is crucial here.

493
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,897
The idea of collecting
is the opposite of purity.

494
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:55,004
<i>The feeling Haydee aroused</i>
<i>in me those days</i>

495
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,271
<i>was at least one of curiosity.</i>

496
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:01,110
<i>She became, in fact,</i>
<i>the center of my interest.</i>

497
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:04,981
<i>That girl, finally accepted</i>
<i>as part of the furnishings,</i>

498
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:09,626
<i>became the focus as she slowly</i>
<i>relegated Daniel to the background.</i>

499
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,700
You're not going out tonight?

500
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,570
No<i>,</i> as you can see.

501
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,706
Want to go out with me?

502
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,436
You're going out?

503
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,403
If you want to.

504
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,583
Shall we all go out?

505
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,980
Come on<i>,</i> Daniel.

506
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,547
I'm high.

507
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,690
I'm staying here.

508
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,151
You two go out.

509
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:48,691
All right.

510
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:51,299
Let's go.

511
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:53,764
Okay.

512
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,074
<i>After an uneventful night,</i>

513
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,714
<i>in which the other girls I met</i>
<i>only acted as foils to Haydee,</i>

514
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,349
<i>prompted by insomnia</i>
<i>and the lateness of the hour,</i>

515
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,985
<i>I decided to rush things a bit.</i>

516
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,788
Young lady<i>,</i> they tell me
your name is Fanchon.

517
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,583
That's right.

518
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:16,817
Pretty name.

519
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,495
You're from Paris?
- That's right.

520
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,392
So my information is correct.

521
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,123
Yes<i>,</i> it's true.

522
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,059
Nice harbor.

523
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,134
Yes<i>,</i> but I'm a bit cold.

524
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,806
But it's so warm.

525
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:33,101
Adrien<i>,</i>
would you get my jacket?

526
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,327
It's beautiful.

527
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,797
Very beautiful.
- Very<i>,</i> very beautiful.

528
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,661
Shall we go?

529
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,268
Yes<i>,</i> let's.

530
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,473
<i>Since we weren't sleepy,</i>
<i>I suggested a drive up the mountain.</i>

531
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:15,576
<i>If she was following a plan,</i>
<i>she was doing a good job of it.</i>

532
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:19,017
<i>If she was trying</i>
<i>to add me to her collection,</i>

533
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:21,748
<i>she was handling things perfectly.</i>

534
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:25,692
<i>One might even argue</i>
<i>that her entire behavior</i>

535
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,364
<i>ever since we met,</i>

536
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:33,468
<i>including her affair with Daniel,</i>
<i>had been the surest way</i>

537
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,970
<i>to arouse my interest in her.</i>

538
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:41,207
<i>If this was indeed true,</i>
<i>she'd succeeded,</i>

539
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,972
<i>a fact I readily admitted.</i>

540
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,989
<i>On the way back, we decided</i>
<i>to swim at our usual spot.</i>

541
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:09,461
<i>I intended to test the soundness</i>
<i>of my hypothesis, despite the risk.</i>

542
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:25,544
You know<i>,</i> it would be easy
to get Daniel back.

543
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,690
He doesn't interest me anymore.

544
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,224
He's far better
than anyone else you've met.

545
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,054
Maybe.
For around here.

546
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,965
Anyway<i>,</i> that's my business.

547
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:41,137
But it bothers me
that you're on bad terms.

548
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,374
This kind of situation amuses me.

549
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,470
Unmitigated happiness bores me.

550
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:53,047
For once you have a chance
at an exceptional guy.

551
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,013
Mind your own business.

552
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:59,246
I came here for peace and quiet<i>,</i>
and you're disturbing it.

553
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:02,983
If everyone minded his own business<i>,</i>
I wouldn't disturb anybody.

554
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,697
Haydee<i>,</i> let's make peace.

555
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,960
- We're not at war.
- Yes<i>,</i> we are.

556
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,604
It's you who keeps
stirring up trouble.

557
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,502
I think you're mistaking
a friendly attitude for a hostile one.

558
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,342
I think you're doing the same.

559
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,514
Then there's no problem.

560
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,348
I don't see any.
You just love to get all worked up.

561
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:36,322
Maybe 'cause I can't fully
bring myself to like you.

562
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,688
We're both indifferent<i>,</i>
and that's fine.

563
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,023
It doesn't mean
we can't live together.

564
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:01,083
I've often wondered
what your smile meant.

565
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,385
Nothing.

566
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,351
That's what I thought.

567
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:23,469
<i>She certainly wouldn't risk</i>
<i>any moves in my direction now.</i>

568
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,474
<i>She was forcing me bit by bit</i>
<i>to compromise my position.</i>

569
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,697
How about a swim?

570
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,874
I'm sleepy.

571
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,542
You coming?

572
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:11,772
<i>But she and Daniel as a couple</i>
<i>made me uneasy.</i>

573
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,380
<i>Their complicity seemed artificial.</i>

574
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:19,180
<i>But was the game they were playing</i>
<i>for their benefit or mine?</i>

575
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:22,415
<i>If the latter,</i>
<i>I was back to my first theory.</i>

576
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,897
<i>Why would such</i>
<i>an easy girl waste time</i>

577
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,067
<i>going after me</i>
<i>in such a roundabout way,</i>

578
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,896
<i>when my rashness</i>
<i>had left her a direct route?</i>

579
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:44,013
<i>But those were the least</i>
<i>of my worries.</i>

580
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:47,012
<i>I had much bigger concerns.</i>

581
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:52,350
<i>I had to organize a meeting</i>
<i>with my antique collector,</i>

582
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:57,289
<i>who was also a likely backer</i>
<i>for the gallery I wanted to open.</i>

583
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:02,561
<i>Preparations for all this</i>
<i>went surprisingly quickly.</i>

584
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,855
What do you think?

585
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,756
It's a very rare Chinese vase.

586
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,865
I've been after it
for three years.

587
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,399
It looks more Hindu or Siamese.

588
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,366
It's the elephants.

589
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,298
It's a Song vase
from the tenth century.

590
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,444
Just before elephants
disappeared from China<i>,</i>

591
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:51,142
before the people rose up.

592
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,684
What about that one?

593
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,564
It looks more Chinese.

594
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,863
That's 'cause it's Japanese.

595
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,901
Satsuma. 19th century.

596
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:18,006
Worthless.
I got it as a bonus.

597
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,800
It's yours.

598
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,077
Thanks. I'll take it.

599
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:37,683
<i>Things were deteriorating quickly</i>
<i>between Daniel and Haydee.</i>

600
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:40,260
<i>Each wanted the upper hand</i>
<i>in breaking up,</i>

601
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,432
<i>which explained all the games.</i>

602
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:47,296
<i>Daniel took the lead and brought</i>
<i>down the curtain in his inimitable style.</i>

603
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,018
Stop it.

604
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,667
Stop it!

605
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,021
That's enough.

606
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,756
Will this go on much longer?

607
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,067
I've never seen a bigger jerk.

608
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,999
What in the world
am I doing here?

609
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:32,873
Shut up<i>,</i> you little bitch!
You have no right to talk.

610
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,608
You were lucky to have
both of us interested in you.

611
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,611
Adrien's right.

612
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,751
You're made for those stupid jerks
who screw you.

613
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:46,252
For a moment I thought
you had something inside

614
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:49,550
that might counter
your pitiful insignificance.

615
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:53,092
That's what fascinated me:
Your insignificance.

616
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,264
I don't even think you're ugly<i>,</i>

617
00:53:55,465 --> 00:54:00,562
but what attracted me were
flashes of ugliness in your face.

618
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,329
At least then
you could move me a bit.

619
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,600
But when you're pretty<i>,</i>
when you're lovely -

620
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,040
what a laugh!

621
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:14,206
You represent the lowest<i>,</i> most
degraded and mindless type of beauty.

622
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,389
Listen to me.

623
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:25,393
Every ray of light has
its strongest and weakest point.

624
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,420
You have to catch it just right.

625
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,600
You can't put it to use
in a vacuum.

626
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,597
You can make it fall
in a straight line<i>,</i>

627
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:36,033
reflect or deflect it<i>,</i>
gather it in or spread it out<i>,</i>

628
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,230
make it round as a bubble<i>,</i>

629
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,432
make it shine
or block it out.

630
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,045
At its weakest point<i>,</i>
it's darkness.

631
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,647
You're definitely beyond all hope.

632
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:54,051
Maybe an Impressionist could
do something<i>,</i> but even then...

633
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:57,922
Anyway<i>,</i> I haven't wasted
that much time on you.

634
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,119
I can't afford to waste any.

635
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,958
End of speech.
Good night.

636
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:09,803
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I've been invited to the Seychelles.

637
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,474
Too bad.

638
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,577
My friend Sam<i>,</i>
the collector I told you about<i>,</i>

639
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,940
is coming tomorrow.

640
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,693
That guy's completely crazy.

641
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,365
I wasted enough time
on him too.

642
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,262
I'm fed up with these
phony nonconformists.

643
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,495
I'm not staying here
another minute.

644
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,378
Is Felix there<i>,</i> please?

645
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,049
That's all right.
I'll call later.

646
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,829
If you have somewhere to go<i>,</i>
I can drive you.

647
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,919
I'm not leaving.

648
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:34,351
This house is as much mine
as it is yours.

649
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,488
I'll write Rodolphe
to get you to leave.

650
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:43,898
You think Rodolphe
will care one whit what you say?

651
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:14,125
You can be sure Daniel spent
all afternoon planning his little speech.

652
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:19,825
Did you believe all that?
- True or not<i>,</i> it's all the same to me.

653
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,832
I detest that kind of scene.

654
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:25,271
Anyway<i>,</i> it's over.

655
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:30,602
I'm staying<i>,</i> but I'm not talking
to either of you.

656
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,479
I'll take the front room.

657
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,613
As you wish.

658
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,286
Okay<i>,</i> we've been real bastards.

659
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:10,944
Your thing with Daniel is none of my
business<i>,</i> but why are you mad at me?

660
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,351
You put those stupid ideas
in his head.

661
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,957
What ideas?
I don't have any ideas.

662
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,892
I've said nothing
but nice things about you.

663
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,399
I can do my own advertising.

664
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,601
The only thing
I might criticize you for

665
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,746
is having so little
sense of humor.

666
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,749
I only criticize people I like.

667
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:45,318
If I really didn't like you<i>,</i>
I wouldn't say a word.

668
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,192
Let's drink to our reconciliation.

669
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,594
Forgive me.
I've been a real bastard.

670
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:03,794
No<i>,</i> you haven't.

671
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:08,137
Yes<i>,</i> you bring out the worst in me<i>,</i>
and I can't help but take the bait.

672
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,883
What bothers me about you

673
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,880
isn't at all what you think.

674
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,450
I don't think anything.

675
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:22,057
You don't know what you want.
It took me a long time to see it.

676
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:24,886
Maybe I don't have what I want<i>,</i>

677
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:27,426
but I do know what it is I want.

678
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,559
And what's that?

679
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,963
To have normal
relationships with people.

680
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:36,627
Somehow I always
mess things up.

681
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,609
I seldom get what I want.

682
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,906
Actually<i>,</i> I've never had it.

683
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:46,377
Did you want Daniel?

684
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:50,349
He was okay.
I don't really call that wanting.

685
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:53,181
I'd have liked to be his friend.

686
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,550
Maybe yours too.

687
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,388
You could be my friend.

688
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,862
I do like you
in my own way. A lot.

689
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:07,867
You keep picking on me<i>,</i>
and Daniel follows your lead.

690
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:10,864
He's old enough
to think for himself.

691
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,474
Besides<i>,</i> right from the start

692
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,610
you brought
those horrid guys here.

693
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,940
- I never brought anyone here.
- What about that first guy?

694
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,844
- Oh<i>,</i> that guy.
- And the ones who come get you?

695
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,612
If they're stupid enough to come get me<i>,</i>
that's their problem.

696
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,619
I haven't gone out in two weeks.

697
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:31,157
And I've said nothing in two weeks.
I said nothing tonight.

698
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,056
You didn't stand up for me.

699
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,025
I'm just lazy.

700
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,358
You'd be glad if I left.

701
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,626
Not at all.
You're quite charming.

702
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,930
- You think I'm ugly.
- I never said that.

703
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,772
I just said
you weren't my type.

704
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,069
But for your type<i>,</i>
you're perfect.

705
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:51,508
Would that be an inferior type?

706
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,773
Somewhere in between.

707
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,417
Besides<i>,</i> my taste
isn't necessarily the best.

708
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,079
Hypocrite.

709
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:01,085
It's not hypocrisy.
It's charm.

710
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,983
Don't think
I look down on you.

711
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:08,061
Far from it. You're far superior
to all your lovers.

712
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:11,358
They're not my lovers.
I have no lovers.

713
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,161
And if I did<i>,</i>
it wouldn't be them.

714
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,895
Besides<i>,</i> I'm free to see
whomever I wish.

715
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,597
No<i>,</i> you're not free.

716
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,903
Just like I'm not free
to go after some ugly girl.

717
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,272
Me?

718
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,340
Your case is entirely different.

719
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:31,452
Girls like you have generally been
a waste of my time.

720
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,713
But you're an exception.

721
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:37,689
I sense that with you it might not be
entirely a waste of time.

722
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,920
In short<i>,</i>
you're a dangerous girl.

723
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,325
Don't you think?

724
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,561
I can't understand
how you believed for a moment...

725
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,706
that I didn't like you.

726
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:56,108
Enough for tonight.
I'm sleepy.

727
01:01:58,114 --> 01:02:00,082
Shall we go to bed?

728
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:04,479
What a great feeling
to be through with both of you.

729
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,848
You never started with me.

730
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,086
Yes<i>,</i> I did.

731
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,815
It was baked
at a relatively low temperature:

732
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,286
570 to 750 degrees.

733
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,956
- You think so?
- I know so.

734
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:46,585
Everyone knows it's characteristic
of vases of that era.

735
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,392
What I like is the ears.

736
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:10,442
I'd like a car at the Bertaud residence<i>,</i>
Ramatuelle Road.

737
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,723
How long?
Five minutes? Thanks.

738
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,323
I can drive you.

739
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:19,790
That's all right.

740
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,038
This is Sam.

741
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,707
This is your collector?

742
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,383
I find collectors
completely uninteresting.

743
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,047
Since I rarely meet one<i>,</i>

744
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,816
let me tell you
how ridiculous you are.

745
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:51,823
That's enough<i>,</i> Daniel.

746
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,695
I hate collectors.

747
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,423
I can't bear the sight of them.

748
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:01,432
I refuse to get mixed up
in your schemes<i>,</i> Adrien.

749
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:05,004
I don't have to flatter people<i>,</i>
especially not these types.

750
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:13,214
Come with me.
I have to talk to you.

751
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,552
He just wanted
to make a scene.

752
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,027
Actually<i>,</i> he's angry at the girl.

753
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,964
She's lovely.

754
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,633
Is she his girlfriend?

755
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,776
Yours?
- Not mine either.

756
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,008
She lives here<i>,</i>

757
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,681
sleeps around a bit.

758
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,680
Actually<i>,</i> a lot.

759
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,012
She's a collector.

760
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:53,114
A collector?

761
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,688
We have something in common.

762
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,660
Are you a part of her collection?

763
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:06,624
You should be.

764
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:09,797
Do you want to be?

765
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,997
- Me?
- Why not?

766
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:15,273
She's the easiest girl
in the world.

767
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,038
I like them hard to get.

768
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,316
Sam<i>,</i> admit you like her.

769
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,583
That's not the question.

770
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,246
The question is<i>,</i>
does she like me?

771
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,424
Don't give it another thought.

772
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,752
She does everything
I tell her to do.

773
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:36,693
There's always
that Machiavellian side to you.

774
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:44,462
You only say that
'cause she left with the other guy.

775
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,541
No<i>,</i> she couldn't have.

776
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,913
Are you sure?

777
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:06,824
<i>Before leaving, I went to apprise</i>
<i>Haydee of the situation.</i>

778
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:11,296
May I?

779
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:18,101
He insists we spend
the night at his place.

780
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:22,673
I can't. I have an important
appointment in the morning.

781
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:27,711
But you could go.

782
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,676
I'll pick you up
the day after tomorrow.

783
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,228
What exactly am I
supposed to do with him?

784
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,124
Whatever you like.

785
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:49,666
But he'll be offended if you refuse<i>,</i>
especially after Daniel's scene.

786
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,498
In short<i>,</i>
I'm the bonus for the vase.

787
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:55,404
It's not just the vase.

788
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:59,172
I'm involved
in a big project with him<i>,</i>

789
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,782
financing a gallery.

790
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:06,516
In business you have
to create a certain climate.

791
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:09,387
A favorable climate.

792
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:13,426
I love doing those kinds of favor.
Especially for you.

793
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,456
Besides<i>,</i> I feel safer
with him than with you.

794
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,191
That could be taken two ways.

795
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,268
I only see one.

796
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:32,171
<i>Of course, this plot</i>
<i>was all a bluff on my part,</i>

797
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,782
<i>and on Sam's,</i>
<i>who loved this kind of joke.</i>

798
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,953
<i>And also on Haydee's,</i>

799
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:40,622
<i>whose readiness</i>
<i>to obey delighted me</i>

800
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:45,055
<i>and united us far better than our</i>
<i>trumped-up secrets of the night before.</i>

801
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,416
<i>The evening was uneventful,</i>

802
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:44,677
<i>and when the moment came,</i>
<i>we all played our parts with great care.</i>

803
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,453
It's time to go.

804
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,426
I have an important appointment
this morning in Nice.

805
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,655
Stay.
I have a spare room.

806
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,027
Thanks<i>,</i> but I hate
getting a couple hours' sleep.

807
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,433
I'd prefer to stay up.

808
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,336
Besides<i>,</i> I have
to take our friend home.

809
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,342
Do as you like...

810
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,973
but I'm keeping Haydee.

811
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:18,717
Do you mind?

812
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,512
Not at all.

813
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:21,815
Okay<i>,</i> then.

814
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:26,727
What would you like for breakfast?
Eggs or cornflakes?

815
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:31,658
Fried eggs with grated cheese<i>,</i>
and lots of cornflakes.

816
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:45,209
<i>I slept all morning, after which</i>
<i>an errand took me into town,</i>

817
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:48,474
<i>where I decided</i>
<i>to spend the rest of the afternoon.</i>

818
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:08,864
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>since I'd arrived, I was bored,</i>

819
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:12,563
<i>and I preferred</i>
<i>to be bored in town.</i>

820
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:21,045
<i>I couldn't wait</i>
<i>to see Sam and Haydee again,</i>

821
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,480
<i>though I knew</i>
<i>not to expect anything,</i>

822
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,779
<i>since nothing</i>
<i>was going to happen.</i>

823
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,988
<i>But the pleasure they'd both taken</i>
<i>in their roles annoyed me.</i>

824
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:33,253
<i>They were now</i>
<i>the center of the action,</i>

825
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:36,954
<i>even if the action was nonexistent,</i>
<i>and I was on the sidelines.</i>

826
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,958
<i>It made me jealous,</i>

827
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,764
<i>and also aware</i>
<i>of how ridiculous I was being.</i>

828
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:47,199
<i>I was certainly not ready to admit</i>

829
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,775
<i>that I could possibly</i>
<i>miss Haydee.</i>

830
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,106
<i>Yet I felt her presence close by,</i>

831
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,942
<i>in stark contrast</i>
<i>to the mass of other girls</i>

832
01:10:55,150 --> 01:11:00,588
<i>whom I'd certainly</i>
<i>have rejected that night.</i>

833
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,266
<i>When the time came</i>
<i>to set out for Sam's villa,</i>

834
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:23,604
<i>I was on edge,</i>

835
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:26,474
<i>furious at myself</i>
<i>and the rest of the world.</i>

836
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,693
Do you speak English?

837
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:43,130
What's the best way
to get to the sea<i>,</i> please?

838
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,696
That way.

839
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:50,064
But the sea's that way.

840
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:05,184
<i>Sam and Haydee welcomed me</i>
<i>with a scene meant to cheer me up,</i>

841
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:08,356
<i>but their complicity irritated me.</i>

842
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:18,858
Did you have a good time?

843
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,092
Lovely.

844
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,232
<i>Sam hammered away all evening</i>

845
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,741
<i>at what he thought</i>
<i>were my weak points.</i>

846
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:33,748
<i>He meant to humiliate me</i>
<i>in front of the girl.</i>

847
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:38,512
To do nothing<i>,</i>
yet think while doing it<i>,</i> is exhausting.

848
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,248
Working's much easier.

849
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:44,489
You follow a well-trod path.

850
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:48,825
There's a kind of laziness to work.
Work is an escape<i>,</i>

851
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,761
a clear conscience
bought on the cheap.

852
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:56,903
Of course<i>,</i> that makes you
the least lazy person I know.

853
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,597
I haven't taken a vacation
in 10 years.

854
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:02,538
Sure.
You're on permanent vacation.

855
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,409
Well<i>,</i> yes and no.
Not exactly.

856
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:11,519
It amuses me how you're always
trying to justify yourself.

857
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,588
On the contrary.
I don't have a guilty conscience.

858
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,516
You're a liar.

859
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:22,094
You feel guilty
because you have no money.

860
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:27,365
Listen<i>,</i> Sam<i>,</i> I'm sure you've heard
of the Tarahumara Indians.

861
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:32,731
When they enter a town<i>,</i>
they beg from house to house.

862
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:37,539
They stop at a door<i>,</i>
then stand in profile

863
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,112
with an air of haughty contempt.

864
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:45,176
Whether given alms or not<i>,</i>
they leave after a set period of time...

865
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,217
without a thank you.

866
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,492
When I beg<i>,</i>
I always turn in profile.

867
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:56,328
Besides<i>,</i> we're always
someone else's slave.

868
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,433
I find less dishonor
in living at a friend's house

869
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,835
than in being
on the government payroll.

870
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:12,745
Most people's work today
is useless.

871
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:16,679
Three quarters
of all activity is parasitic.

872
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:20,077
I'm not the parasite.

873
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,150
It's the bureaucrats
and experts.

874
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:27,294
If I were 6'6"
with an eagle's profile<i>,</i>

875
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:31,296
I'd feel nearer
to the gods too.

876
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:37,964
You're nostalgic
for the good old days<i>,</i>

877
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:41,631
while I'm happy to live
in this modern world.

878
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:46,541
I'm as modern as you are.

879
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:50,548
But what matters today
isn't work but laziness.

880
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:54,251
Everyone says work
is just a means to an end.

881
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,785
We speak of a leisure society.

882
01:14:56,992 --> 01:15:00,325
But when it comes<i>,</i>
we won't know what leisure is.

883
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:04,254
Some people work 40 years
for their life of leisure<i>,</i>

884
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:08,732
but when the time comes<i>,</i>
they're lost<i>,</i> and they die.

885
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,308
In all sincerity<i>,</i>

886
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:18,606
I think I serve mankind better
by taking it easy than by working.

887
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:24,846
It's true.
It takes courage to not work.

888
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,883
More courage
than going to the moon?

889
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:32,226
Of course you can go
to the moon too.

890
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:35,261
But that's both fascinating
and contemptible.

891
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:39,926
If I listen to any more
of your little monologue<i>,</i>

892
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:42,626
I'll fall asleep
right in this chair.

893
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,468
You're like a small child<i>,</i>

894
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:56,083
happy as can be
with his mediocre life.

895
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:01,480
Go to the moon<i>,</i> Adrien.

896
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,681
Jupiter too.

897
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,553
Hurry...

898
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,729
and when you get there<i>,</i>

899
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:10,922
send me a postcard<i>,</i>

900
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:14,497
if you have
the money to buy one.

901
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:22,008
I've always been sorry
I wasn't rich.

902
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:27,304
But if I were<i>,</i> my dandyism<i>,</i>
as you call it<i>,</i> would be too easy...

903
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:31,011
lacking any heroism whatsoever.

904
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:34,382
And I can't imagine
a dandy not being heroic.

905
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:02,278
Do you find
his metaphysical monologue

906
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:04,543
as interesting as Tarzan?

907
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:08,314
Don't mind him.
He talks to hear himself talk.

908
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,184
She's right.

909
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:23,998
Careful!

910
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,007
Very clever!

911
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,987
She's impossible.

912
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,728
Your rooms are
on the second floor.

913
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:56,403
Good night.

914
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,212
And you laugh!

915
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,419
You don't just break
a Song vase.

916
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:17,786
I break whatever I like.
Besides<i>,</i> you got your money.

917
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:20,291
Still<i>,</i> you don't just break
a Song vase.

918
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:22,656
I didn't do it on purpose.

919
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:26,227
You think it's funny too.

920
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:29,729
A professional collector
would've killed you.

921
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:33,502
You're impossible.
I should have known.

922
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,904
I knew I couldn't
take you anywhere.

923
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,341
You shouldn't have left me
with him for two days.

924
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,742
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing.

925
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:43,041
Did he bother you?

926
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:46,414
Not at all.
He took me boating.

927
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:49,818
Last night he took me
to the casino. It was lovely.

928
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,322
Are you upset
'cause he didn't try anything?

929
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:59,762
Would you believe me
if I said I slept with him?

930
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:02,870
I'd believe anything<i>,</i>
coming from you.

931
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,972
I know if you say yes<i>,</i>
it probably means no

932
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:08,506
but could just as well mean yes.

933
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:23,556
You're an immoral little slut.

934
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,286
Well<i>,</i> I certainly wouldn't espouse
your moral code.

935
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:34,659
Neither would I.

936
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:38,328
Besides<i>,</i> I feel like giving
my morals the slip tonight.

937
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,432
I'm sleepy.

938
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:43,968
Shall we go upstairs?

939
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,045
No<i>,</i> let's go home.

940
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,150
<i>The die was cast.</i>

941
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,588
<i>She'd shown</i>
<i>she had the upper hand.</i>

942
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,262
<i>I was back</i>
<i>to my pet theory once again.</i>

943
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,794
<i>For three weeks,</i>

944
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:07,128
<i>it was as if she'd acted</i>
<i>with the sole idea of possessing me.</i>

945
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:11,138
<i>Daniel, Sam,</i>
<i>and now the broken vase</i>

946
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:15,298
<i>were all just stations on the path</i>
<i>to conquering precious me.</i>

947
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:19,844
<i>My protective moral fortress</i>
<i>was tumbling down.</i>

948
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:23,174
<i>Since I'd come to Rodolphe's</i>
<i>in search of pleasure,</i>

949
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:26,513
<i>why not use</i>
<i>my one week left</i>

950
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:29,713
<i>to enjoy my interactions</i>
<i>with Haydee to the utmost?</i>

951
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:33,122
<i>An affair so clearly</i>
<i>circumscribed</i>

952
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:36,593
<i>in time and space</i>
<i>met my definition of total adventure.</i>

953
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:42,327
<i>One week was the ideal length</i>
<i>I'd have liked my casual affairs to last,</i>

954
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:46,530
<i>and not the one-night stands or</i>
<i>endless ordeals they'd been till now.</i>

955
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,333
It's Haydee!

956
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:51,543
Wait a minute.

957
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,775
Want to come with us?

958
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:56,307
- Where?
- Lorenzo's.

959
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:57,507
In Rome?

960
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:59,949
No<i>,</i> his villa in San Felice.

961
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:02,851
- I can't right now.
- Take the address.

962
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:04,047
Wait.

963
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,768
San Felice.

964
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:20,803
I said I can't right now.

965
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,306
Drop him.

966
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,034
Give me the address.

967
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,947
- Let's go.
- I have nothing to wear.

968
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:47,564
<i>When I started the engine,</i>
<i>it was just to clear the road</i>

969
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:51,170
<i>and perhaps put an end</i>
<i>to Haydee's dallying.</i>

970
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:54,633
<i>But I quickly realized</i>
<i>I wasn't going to stop</i>

971
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:59,007
<i>and that I was making</i>
<i>the right decision for the first time.</i>

972
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:03,908
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of my twists and turns.</i>

973
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:09,386
<i>The way was finally cleared for the</i>
<i>decision of my first days here.</i>

974
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:14,290
<i>Now I could actually live</i>
<i>my vacation dream.</i>

975
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:17,829
<i>Peace and solitude</i>
<i>were at last mine for the taking.</i>

976
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:20,092
<i>They weren't just handed to me.</i>

977
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:24,796
<i>I'd gained the right to them</i>
<i>by at last asserting my freedom.</i>

978
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:26,803
<i>I reveled in my victory</i>

979
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:30,671
<i>and ascribed it to my actions alone,</i>
<i>not chance.</i>

980
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,270
<i>I was overwhelmed by a feeling</i>

981
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,039
<i>of exquisite freedom.</i>

982
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,582
<i>Now I could do</i>
<i>whatever I wanted.</i>

983
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:05,607
<i>But once back in the emptiness</i>
<i>and silence of the house,</i>

984
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:09,011
<i>I was seized with anxiety</i>
<i>and unable to sleep.</i>

985
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:12,529
Is this the airport?

986
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:15,225
When's your next flight
to London?

987
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:17,169
Yes<i>,</i> today.
